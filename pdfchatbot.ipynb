While walking with a friend, they are surrounded by a gang of kids. Percy then begins telling a story to someone listening to a recording, warning them that they are in danger and giving them instructions to find a package that will grant them almost unlimited power, which they must not keep for more than a week. Percy's story starts in London, where he confronts the god Ares and demands information about his mother. Ares tells him that she was taken away from the Minotaur before she could die and turned into a shower of gold, and is being kept as a hostage to control someone else. Ares warns Percy that they will meet again and he should watch his back.\n",

Poseidon acknowledges Percy as his son and gives him a package, which contains a powerful weapon that Percy will need in his future adventures. Percy's mother, Sally Jackson, is aware of her son's divine heritage and has been trying to protect him from the dangerous world of the gods. She is married to Gabe Ugliano, who is abusive to both her and Percy. The circumstances surrounding Sally's disappearance and the discovery of traces of blood in the car and at the scene of the accident suggest that she may have been the victim of foul play. Percy is determined to find out what happened to his mother and bring those responsible to justice.\n",
